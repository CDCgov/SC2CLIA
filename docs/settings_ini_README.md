### Purpose
A general purpose configuration file for the CDC SC2CLIA pipeline. It's mainly for the parameters that're not directly accessible by nextflow.  

We defined there 2 parameters that're related to our R report container. If you have database components to be embedded with the pipeline, you can also put DB credentials there.
